# Election Worker Management System

A comprehensive smart contract system for election offices to manage poll worker recruitment, training, and assignment coordination for elections.

## Overview

The Election Worker Management System digitizes and streamlines the process of managing election workers (poll workers) throughout their lifecycle - from recruitment through training to polling location assignment. This system provides election offices with tools to ensure adequate staffing, track worker qualifications, and coordinate assignments efficiently.

## Real-World Application

Election offices across municipalities must recruit, train, and deploy hundreds or thousands of poll workers for each election. This involves:
- Recruiting qualified workers
- Tracking training completion and certification
- Managing worker availability
- Assigning workers to polling locations based on qualifications and proximity
- Ensuring adequate coverage at each polling location

This smart contract system automates these workflows, providing transparency and efficiency in election worker management.

## Core Features

### Worker Registration & Profile Management
- Register new election workers with personal information
- Track worker experience level and past assignments
- Manage worker availability and preferences
- Update contact information and status

### Training & Certification
- Record training completion dates
- Track certification status and expiration
- Manage different training levels (basic, advanced, supervisor)
- Verify worker qualifications

### Polling Location Management
- Register polling locations with capacity requirements
- Track location details (address, required staff count)
- Manage location status (active/inactive)
- Record special requirements

### Assignment Coordination
- Assign workers to polling locations
- Verify worker qualifications match location requirements
- Prevent over-assignment of workers
- Track assignment status and history

### Election Day Management
- Check-in workers at polling locations
- Record attendance and hours worked
- Track no-shows and substitutions
- Manage real-time staffing coverage

## Technical Details

### Smart Contract: election-worker-manager.clar

The contract implements the following key functions:

**Worker Management:**
- `register-worker` - Register new election workers
- `update-worker-status` - Modify worker availability/status
- `complete-training` - Record training completion
- `get-worker-info` - Retrieve worker details

**Location Management:**
- `register-polling-location` - Add new polling locations
- `update-location-capacity` - Adjust staffing requirements
- `get-location-info` - Retrieve location details

**Assignment Operations:**
- `assign-worker` - Assign worker to polling location
- `unassign-worker` - Remove worker assignment
- `check-in-worker` - Record worker attendance
- `get-assignment-info` - Query assignment details

**Administrative Functions:**
- Role-based access control for election administrators
- Query functions for reporting and oversight
- Assignment validation and conflict prevention

## Data Structures

The contract maintains several key data maps:
- **workers** - Worker profiles, training status, and qualifications
- **polling-locations** - Location details and staffing requirements
- **assignments** - Worker-to-location assignments for elections
- **check-ins** - Attendance tracking for election day

## Use Cases

1. **Pre-Election Planning**: Register workers, conduct training, and plan assignments
2. **Worker Recruitment**: Track applications and onboarding progress
3. **Training Management**: Schedule and verify training completion
4. **Assignment Coordination**: Match qualified workers to locations
5. **Election Day Operations**: Track attendance and manage coverage
6. **Post-Election Review**: Analyze worker performance and participation

## Security & Governance

- Only authorized election administrators can register locations and modify critical data
- Workers can update their own availability and preferences
- Assignment validation prevents conflicts and over-assignment
- Immutable audit trail of all operations for transparency
- Training verification ensures only qualified workers are assigned

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet CLI installed
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contracts
- Node.js for running tests

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to project directory
cd election-worker-management

# Run contract checks
clarinet check

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Usage Example

```clarity
;; Register a new polling location
(contract-call? .election-worker-manager register-polling-location 
  u1 
  "City Hall - Main Entrance" 
  u5)

;; Register a new worker
(contract-call? .election-worker-manager register-worker 
  'SP123... 
  "John Doe" 
  "john@email.com")

;; Complete training
(contract-call? .election-worker-manager complete-training 'SP123...)

;; Assign worker to location
(contract-call? .election-worker-manager assign-worker 
  'SP123... 
  u1 
  u1729612800)
```
